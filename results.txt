Algorithm Used: Lagrange Interpolation
- The constant term of the polynomial is found by evaluating P(0) using Lagrange interpolation
- For a polynomial of degree m, we need m+1 points to uniquely determine it
- The solution correctly decodes values from various bases (2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16)
- BigInt arithmetic is used to handle large numbers within 256-bit range
